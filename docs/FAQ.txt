Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

== General

=== Is Thruk an Abbreviation? What does Thruk mean?

Thruk is just a random word and has no meaning. Pronounce it like 'Truck'.


=== Where is the statusmap?

The statusmap is currently under development and will be included in future
releases.


=== Authorization/Authentication is not working

Authentication is done by the webserver, so authentication is only available
with the fastcgi version.




== Usage

=== How do i select hosts/services on the status page?

Just click on the empty table row when the row is highlighted. This only works
if you do not click on a link.




== Customization

=== How can i add more themes?

Themes are located under 'root/thruk/themes/'. Just copy and modify the one you
like.


=== How can i disable themes?

This is not possible at the moment. However, you could remove the theme
physically from 'root/thruk/themes/'. Make sure you replace symlinks from other
themes with proper files if you remove the Classic theme.




== Installation

=== How can i enable debug mode?
==== Thruk Server
For a quick test without authorization, you can start the thruk server
with './script/thruk_server.pl -d'. Make sure your log4perl.conf has
DEBUG theshold configured. You can also move your log4perl.conf away,
so all debug output will be sent to the terminal.

==== FastCGI Server
This is a bit more complicate.
First you have to enable debuging for your thruk application.
Add '-Debug' to the use Catalyst in your lib/Thruk.pm. The part
should look like this:
------------------
  use Catalyst qw/
                -Debug
                Unicode::Encoding
                Authentication
                Authorization::ThrukRoles
                CustomErrorMessage
                ConfigLoader
                StackTrace
                Static::Simple
                Redirect
                Compress::Gzip
                /;
  our $VERSION = '0.60';
------------------

Then make sure you have a log4perl.conf with DEBUG threshold configured. 
Finally restart your fastcgi server.
