=== Fixed Ranges

Usually there is a set of predefined ranges, like `last week` to choose from.
They should be pretty much self-explanatory.


==== Time Arithmetics
If the predefined fixed ranges don't fit, you can also use basic self defined time arithmetics like `today - 2d` which is 2 days before today.

Available terms:

     ** `now`            Current time.
     ** `today`          Refers to today at 00:00.
     ** `yesterday`      Yesterday at 00:00.
     ** `lastmonday`     Last Monday at 00:00.

Simple calculation are possible like this:

Tuesday 00:00 of current week: `lastmonday + 86400`

The following suffixes can be used to make times more human readable:

  - `y`: years
  - `w`: weeks
  - `d`: days
  - `h`: hours
  - `m`: minutes

So the example above could also be written as: `lastmonday + 1d`

[WARNING]

These calculation do no timezone or daylight saving adjustments.
