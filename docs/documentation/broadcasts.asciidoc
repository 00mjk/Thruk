== Broadcast Announcements
{% include new_since.ad version="2.14" %}
Broadcasts are a way to communicate news or any other relevant information to
Thruk users. They will be displayed on all pages except the panorama dashboard.
Broadcasts will be displayed on each page every time until they expire or the
user clicks the dismiss link.

=== Create new Broadcast

Broadcasts have to be created manually under the `var/broadcasts` folder. Each
news goes into one file with the `.json` extension. The var folder is usually
`/var/lib/thruk/broadcast` or `~/var/thruk/broadcast` when using OMD. You might
have to create the folder first.

A full example might look like this:

./var/lib/thruk/broadcast/2017-02-09-example.json
------
{
  "text":         "<b>Announcement:</b> The last update introduced broadcasts, read more at <a href='https://thruk.org' target='_blank'>thruk.org</a>.",
  "contacts":      [],
  "contactgroups": [],
  "hide_before":  "2017-02-01 00:00:00",
  "expires":      "2018-01-01 00:00:00"
}
------

[TIP]
.filenames
=======
Broadcasts are sorted by the filename, so use filenames of the pattern YYYY-MM-DD-title like: 2017-02-08-release-announcement.json
=======

A broadcast can have these attributes:

     ** `text`           This is the raw text of your news. It may contain html and css to customize look and feel.
     ** `contacts`       A list of contacts which should receive the broadcast.
     ** `contactgroups`  A list of contactgroups which should receive the broadcast.
     ** `hide_before`    If set, the broadcast will not be shown before this date. Format is: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
     ** `expires`        If set, the broadcast will not be shown after this date. Format is: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

All attributes except the text itself are optional.


=== Authorization

Broadcasts are public for all contacts and users except if `contacts` and/or
`contactgroups` are specified.


=== Examples

The most simple example contains nothing but a text message. It will be display
for all users.

------
{
  "text": "<b>Announcement:</b> this is a simple broadcased news."
}
------


The next broadcast is limited to two contactgroups.

------
{
  "text":          "<b>Announcement:</b> this is a broadcased for admins and operators only.",
  "contactgroups": ["Admins", "Operators"]
}
------
