Todo List:

- create models for hosts / services / contacts
- reload cgi.cfg if changed
- is_authorized_for_read_only in Catalyst::Authentication::Store::FromCGIConf
- comments on extinfo type 1/2
- * in the cgi.cfg
- no commands if authorization is disabled
- overload role authentication
- add comments on status_hostdetails page
- add authorization part to all querys
- fix pending state on host/service details page (should be just a empty message)
- comments on outage page
- speed up status overview page (too many queries)
- verify macros is action_url, icon_url and notes_url
