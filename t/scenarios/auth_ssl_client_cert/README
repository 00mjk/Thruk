= SSL Client Certificate Authorization

This scenario creates a CA along with a client certificate and uses this to
authenticate. The main challenge is the Apache Reverse Proxy which terminates
ssl and therefor the client authentication. So we terminate and authenticate
the user at system apache level and forward the username with a superuser
api key.

             +----------+               +-----------+
